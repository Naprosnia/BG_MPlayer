# BG_MPlayer for ES-DE Frontend (Windows)

**BG_MPlayer** is a simple set of scripts that adds background music playback to the **Windows version of ES-DE** (https://es-de.org/).

It supports two playback engines:  
- **fmedia** ‚Äì lightweight and fast (default)  
- **VLC** ‚Äì heavier but more versatile

All required dependencies are included in the installation package ‚Äî no separate setup needed.

This project was created and tested on **Windows 11**. Compatibility with other versions of Windows (such as Windows 10 or earlier) is **not guaranteed**.

2. Extract the **contents** into the **root folder of ES-DE installation**.
3. Make sure **"Enable custom event scripts"** is enabled in the **"Other Settings"** section of the ES-DE menu.
