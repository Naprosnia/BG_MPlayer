# BG_MPlayer for ES-DE Frontend (Windows)

**BG_MPlayer** is a simple set of scripts that adds background music playback to the **Windows version of ES-DE** (https://es-de.org/).

It uses **VLC** to play music, and **all required dependencies are included** in the installation package — no separate setup needed.

---

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Download the latest `.zip` file from the **[Releases](../../releases)** section.
2. Extract the contents into the **root folder of ES-DE**.
3. Make sure **"Custom Scripts"** are enabled in the ES-DE settings.

Once installed, background music should start automatically when you launch ES-DE.

## 🎵 Music Folder

Music files should be placed in:

ES-DE\ROMs\music

You can place audio files directly in that folder or organize them into subfolders — the player will **shuffle and play all files** randomly.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All settings can be adjusted in the `config.ini` file located at:

ES-DE\BG_MPlayer\config.ini

Inside that file, you can:

- Set the background music **volume**
- Configure **fade in/out effects**
- Enable playback **during gameplay**
- Tweak other small options to better suit your preferences

Each option is explained with comments directly in the file.
